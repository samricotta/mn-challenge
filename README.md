# Mn_challenge

## Instructions

I have used a Rails (5.2) app for this challenge so to launch the app you need to run:

```
bundle install
```
```
rails db:create
```
```
rails db:migrate
```
```
rails db:seed
```
then

```
rails s
```

and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Automated tests

The tests are located in the 'spec' folder and are sorted into controller and model tests.

As I had to learn rspec for this test, there arent that many tests but if I had more time I would have definitely implemented more. I had quite a few tests to complete this week so I only had a couple of days for this test.

Please run

```
rspec
```
to run the tests.
